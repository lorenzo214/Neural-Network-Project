In this project i'm going to implement the SHUFFLING RECURRENT NEURAL NETWORKS (SRNN) (www.arxiv.org/abs/2007.07324), a RNN architecture in wich the previous hidden state is multiplied by a fixed permutation matrix.
With this mecchanism it is possible to obtain an efficient and simple RNN that does not suffer from vanishing and exploding gradients.
